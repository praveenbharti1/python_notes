    "- **NOTE**: an *object variable* with the same name as a *class variable* will hide the class variable!\n",

    "**object methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- in the `say_hi` built-in object method, the robot outputs a greeting \n",
    "\n",
    "- in the `die` built-in object method, we simply decrease the `Robot.population` count by 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**docstrings**\n",
    "\n",
    "- in this program, we see the use of `docstrings` for classes as well as methods\n",
    "  - we can access the class docstring using `Robot.__doc__` and the method docstring as `Robot.say_hi.__doc__`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**constructor function**\n",
    "\n",
    "- observe that the `__init__` method is used to initialize the `Robot` instance with a name \n",
    "  - in this method, we increase the population count by 1 since we have one more robot being added \n",
    "  - also observe that the values of `self.name` is specific to each object which indicates the nature of object variables\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**class variable**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `population` belongs to the `Robot` class \n",
    "  - hence is a *class variable* \n",
    "\n",

    "- the `how_many` is actually a method that belongs to the class and not to the object\n",

    "- this means we can define it as either a `classmethod` or a `staticmethod` depending on whether we need to know which class we are part of\n",
    "  - since we refer to a *class variable*, let's use `classmethod`\n",
    "\n",
    "- we have marked the `how_many` method as a class method using a decorator\n",
    "\n",
    "- *decorators* can be imagined to be a shortcut to calling a wrapper function (i.e. a function that \"wraps\" around another function so that it can do something before or after the inner function), so applying the `@classmethod` decorator is the same as calling:\n",

    "\n",
    "- to use inheritance, we specify the parent-class names in a tuple following the class name in the class definition \n",
    "  - for example, `class Teacher(SchoolMember)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- next, we observe that the `__init__` method of the parent-class is explicitly called using the `self` variable so that we can initialize the parent class part of an instance in the child-class \n",
    "  - since we are defining a `__init__` method in *Teacher* and *Student* subclasses, Python does not automatically call the constructor of the child-class `SchoolMember`, you have to explicitly call it yourself\n",
    "  - in contrast, if we had not defined an `__init__` method in the child-classes, Python will call the constructor of the parent-class automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "- while we could treat instances of *Teacher* or *Student* as we would an instance of `SchoolMember` and access the tell method of `SchoolMember` by simply typing `Teacher.tell` or `Student.tell`, we instead define another `tell` method in each child-class (using the `tell` method of `SchoolMember` for part of it) to tailor it for that subclass   \n",
    "  - because we have done this, when we write `Teacher.tell`, Python uses the `tell` method for that child-class vs the parent-class\n",
    "  - however, if we did not have a `tell` method in the child-class, Python would use the `tell` method in the parent-class \n",
    "  - Python always starts looking for methods in the actual child-class type first\n",
    "    - and if it doesn’t find anything, it starts looking at the methods in the child-class's parent-classes, one-by-one in the order they are specified in the tuple in the class definition\n",
    "\n",
    "- here we only have 1 base class, but you can have *multiple parent classes*\n",
    "\n",
    "- a note on terminology - if more than one class is listed in the inheritance tuple, then it is called **multiple inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "- the `end` parameter is used in the `print` function in the parent-class's `tell()` method to print a line and allow the next `print` to continue on the same line\n",
    "  - this is a trick to make `print` not print a `\\n` (newline) symbol at the end of the printing"
